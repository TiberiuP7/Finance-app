# Finance-app

Finance is an app idea for a web app where you can buy stock shares for any of the companies on the IEX stock market. It has a few other functions, like SELL where you sell the stock you own, QUOTE where you can watch what stock you own and their value. You also have a wallet function, where you could add an amount of money to your wallet, or even withdraw funds from it. This is only happening in the database, but it can be a base point and be developed to have real world functionalities.   

###It can be connected to an API key from IEX stock exchange and like so have avalaible all the shares. It also has the Register, Log in and Log out functions.
